# complexroads

#### University of Amsterdam project for the course Complex System Simulation, of the master program Computational Science.

This git contains all the code for the project (except for the website), but most of it requires the gROADS dataset(http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/groads-global-roads-open-access-v1).
Furthermore, some of it is somewhat messy, as it was to be used internally for gathering information.

However, graph.ipynb and "Random network.ipynb" have been adapted to be runnable as-is, and to be outsider-friendly. Preprocessed data is part of the repository, and results that would take too long to compute have been pre-computed.

Thus, graph.ipynb and "Random network.ipynb" can be run from the top, in either order, and this should show results like in the presentation, except that it ignores the entire world except for Australia.
