# complexroads
Project for computational science about road maps

Todo:
- Better selection of continents (done)
- Make use of the weights (distance, flow afterwards)
- Remove small roads
- give endpoints a node (done)
- Removal of nodes with degree of 2 (done)
- Compare topologies

- Perhaps bounds on intersections gives better speed

Idea's:
- Navier stokes flow simulations instead of individual agenets
- some dynamical process would be nice
- Make placeses popular
- flow distributions...?
